<!-- pre-hook -->
```{r pre-hook, child = "_prehook.Rmd", include = FALSE, order = 0}
```

Instead of the more idiomatic `substr()` approach, you can also use `gsub()` with the `{n}` quantifier to extract first `n` characters.

# Basic idea

```{r}
ipsum <- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
nchar(ipsum)
```

::: {.side .side-right}
Or `substring()`, for "compatibility with S"
:::

To cut the text up to 30 chars, you can use `substr()`:

```{r}
substr(ipsum, 1, 30)
```

If you wanted to add a trailing ellipse, you can `paste0()` onto that output:

```{r}
paste0(substr(ipsum, 1, 30), "...")
```

::: {.side .side-right}
Oddly enough, the assignment variant `` `substr<-`(ipsum, 31, nchar(ipsum), "...") `` fails to achieve this effect. What you get instead is "..." masking a span of the same length, ranging index 31-to-33 of the input string.
:::

But if you use `gsub()` instead, you can express all that in a single line:

```{r}
gsub("^(.{30}).*$", "\\1...", ipsum)
```

# Some advantages

A nice feature of `gsub()` is that if a pattern isn't matched, it simply skips the replacement. This takes care of the often annoying conditional where you'd only want the trailing "..." if there's actually more content past the snippet.

```{r}
gsub("^(.{30}).*$", "\\1...", "short text")
```

Another often desired effect is to avoid truncating mid-word. This is simple to express in regex, by simply topping off the pattern group with _any non-whitespace character_ (`\\S*`) that could be matched.

```{r}
gsub("^(.{30}\\S*).*$", "\\1...", ipsum)
```

At that point you can also change the substitution pattern to place a space after the last word, to emphasize the word boundary:

```{r}
gsub("^(.{30}\\S*).*$", "\\1 ...", ipsum)
```

Needless to say, you can also truncate from both ends:

```{r}
gsub("^(.{30}\\S*).*(\\S*.{30})$", "\\1 ... \\2", ipsum)
```

<!-- post-hook -->
```{r post-hook, child = "_posthook.Rmd"}
```
